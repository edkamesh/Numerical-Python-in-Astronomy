# Numerical-Python-in-Astronomy

Making observations is an essential part of astronomy, but most
researchers do not operate instruments directly any longer. Most of the time they
receive huge amounts of data from remote or even space-bound telescopes and
make heavy use of computing power to filter, process, and analyse these data. This
requires sophisticated algorithms and, these days, increasingly utilizes machine
learning. On the theoretical side of astrophysics, making important discoveries just
with pencil and paper belongs to the past (with the occasional exception from the
rule). Scientific questions in contemporary astrophysics are often too complex to
allow for analytic solutions. As a consequence, numerical computations with a great
wealth of physical details play a major role in research now. Back-of-the-envelope
calculations still serve their purpose to guide researchers, but at the end of the day it
is hardly possible to make progress without writing and running code on computers
to gain a deeper understanding of the physical processes behind observed
phenomena
